    <h1>WebTangle</h1>
    <p>
      WebTangle is the backend library used for this website. It is my own creation.
      It is a lightweight library for http servers written in C using nothing 
      but the C standard library.

    <h2>Why make this?</h2>
    <p>
      Fantastic question, why did I make a library for creating http servers in
      C of all languages instead of using one that has more features, is more 
      reliable and can tolerate failures I haven't conceived of. Well, I just
      wanted to, really. It is interesting to know how the world around us works
      and even if this remains a shitty little library I have learned just a 
      little more about it.
    </p>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <p>
      This project has taught me about servers operate and the complexity that
      is required to create that server that can handle many concurrent 
      visitors, handle various issues around routing requests and most 
      importantly (drum roll please) string manipulation in C!!!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously, a http server requires you to do a lot of string manipulation
      and doing so efficiently is important.
