    <p>This site is a personal project of mine, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/LeonByrne/Http-Blunder">here.</a></p>

    <p>I made this site for two reasons. One, to learn more about html, css and javascript. Two, to test my library WebTangle, designed for creating simple http servers in C/C++. You can also find WebTangle <a href="https://github.com/LeonByrne/WebTangle">here.</a></p>
  
    <p>This site is subject to immense change as I learn more about frontend development and improve the functionality of WebTangle to enable more features.</p>
  
    <p> 
      The backend for this site was made using a library I made! 
      It is called <a href="WebTangle">WebTangle</a>.
